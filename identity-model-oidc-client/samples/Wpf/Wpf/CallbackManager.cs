/// <summary>
///  The CallbackManager coordinates communication between two instances of the
///  application that are needed because we are using a custom url scheme.
///
///  First, the main instance of the application initiates the OIDC flow by
///  opening a browser window and navigating to the authorize endpoint, passing
///  the OIDC parameters. Notably the callback_uri passed here uses a custom
///  scheme, like this: oidcclient-wpf-sample://callback.
///
///  When the user finishes authentication in the browser, the response from the
///  identity provider is a redirect back to the callback uri at the custom
///  scheme. This redirect includes query parameters needed to continue the OIDC
///  flow, such as the authorization code. The OidcClient library needs those
///  parameters to continue processing. 
///
/// The custom scheme has been configured in the registry to use this
/// application (see see RegistryConfig.cs). When the browser is redirected to
/// the custom scheme it will therefore invoke this application. But this means
/// that a second instance of the application is actually started, and we
/// therefore have the OIDC state that initiated the challenge in one process,
/// while we have the callback url needed to continue the flow in another
/// process. 
///
/// The callback url is sent from one process to the other using a named pipe.
/// This class manages those named pipes and provides an abstraction around the
/// communication process.
